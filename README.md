# Description of Project

### Project Overview
As part of Indonesia’s long-term development strategy, Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Panjang Nasional (RPJPN) 2025-2045, the government is focusing on achieving "Indonesia Emas 2045" by fostering three key transformations: social, economic, and governmental. To contribute to this vision, Indonesia’s 2024 elected president, Prabowo Subianto, has introduced the "Makan Siang Gratis" (Free Lunch) program. This initiative aims to combat malnutrition and stunting by providing free nutritious meals to schoolchildren and pregnant women.

The goal of this project is to analyze how fighting malnutrition and stunting through this program supports social transformation, one of the three key pillars of Indonesia's development strategy. This analysis explores how improving nutrition can positively impact health and education, contributing to Indonesia’s long-term growth and prosperity.

### Project Structure
This project follows a structured approach, documented through the following steps:

  - Data Preparation: Collecting and consolidating data from credible sources, focusing on nutrition, health outcomes, and economic indicators.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to identify key insights related to malnutrition, stunting, and their socio-economic impacts.
  - Findings Presentation: Summarizing insights into a cohesive presentation using slides to demonstrate the program’s potential impact on Indonesia’s social transformation.

### Data source
World Bank: Provides data on life expectancy, malnutrition, stunting, and key development indicators.

### Tools
  - Python: exploratory data analysis
  - Google slides: presenting finding and insight

### Project Goals
This project aims to explore how the "Makan Siang Gratis" program can directly contribute to the social transformation outlined in RPJPN 2025-2045. By addressing malnutrition and stunting, the initiative can support healthier, more educated, and productive generations that will drive Indonesia towards achieving its "Indonesia Emas 2045" vision.
